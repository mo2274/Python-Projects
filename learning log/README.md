# learning log:

This web app called Learning Log that allows users to
log the topics theyâ€™re interested in and to make journal entries as
they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page will
describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once
logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read
and edit existing entries.


### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.8.1

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/learning log` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the server

From within the `/learning log` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

run:

```bash
python manage.py runserver 9000
```

then open your browser and open:
http://127.0.0.1:9000/

and finally if you have any feedback it will be very welcomed.
